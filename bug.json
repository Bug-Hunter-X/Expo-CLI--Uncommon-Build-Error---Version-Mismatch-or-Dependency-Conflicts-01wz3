This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI you have installed and the version required by your project.  It can also happen if your project's dependencies are outdated or conflicting.

```javascript
// Example project code (app.json)
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My App",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "sdkVersion": "47.0.0" // Or any other version
  }
}
```

The error message itself might not directly point to a specific line of code but rather indicate a problem with the project configuration or dependency management.
