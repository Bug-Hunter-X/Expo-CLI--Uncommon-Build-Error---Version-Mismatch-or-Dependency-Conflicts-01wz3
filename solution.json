The solution involves updating Expo CLI, and the project's dependencies.  In some cases, clearing the Expo cache may be necessary.

1. **Update Expo CLI:**
   ```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
   or
   ```bash
yarn global add expo-cli
```
2. **Update Project Dependencies:** Make sure `package.json` has the correct versions of all dependencies.  Consider using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update to the latest compatible versions. You might need to manually adjust version numbers in `package.json` to resolve conflicts.
3. **Check `app.json`:** Ensure that the `sdkVersion` in your `app.json` is compatible with your installed Expo CLI and dependencies. You might need to consult the Expo documentation for recommended `sdkVersion`.
4. **Clear Expo Cache (if necessary):**
   ```bash
expo prebuild --clean
```
5. **Restart:** After applying any updates, restart your Expo development server with `expo start`.
